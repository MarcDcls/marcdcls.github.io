      <title>Pneumatic artificial muscles</title>
      <link>https://marcdcls.github.io/projects/muscle_artificiel/</link>

      <description>Principle Pneumatic artificial muscles, also known as McKibben muscles, are actuators comparable to biological muscles, the principle of which was proposed in the 1950s by Joseph McKibben. They are capable of contraction, meaning that when activated, they change from an initial resting elongation to a reduced elongation.</description>

      <description>Fuller&amp;rsquo;s Projections The Fuller&amp;rsquo;s projections  are cartographic projections of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s map onto regular polygonal surfaces. Applied in 1946 to a cuboctahedron and in 1954 to an icosahedron, these projections are called the Dymaxion map, from dynamic maximum tension.</description>
